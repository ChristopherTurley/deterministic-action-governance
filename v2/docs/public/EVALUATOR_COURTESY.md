# Evaluator Courtesy Note (Optional)

This note is optional.

If you are already comfortable reviewing governance artifacts, contracts, and legal controls, you can safely skip this file and proceed directly through the Start Here flow.

This document exists only to provide orientation and respect your time.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is **not** a product runtime and **not** an AI agent.

It is a **governance reference artifact** that demonstrates how an AI system can be:
- useful
- deterministic
- auditable
- fail-closed by default

VERA exists to answer a narrow but important question:

> How do we allow AI to assist humans **without** allowing it to act silently, unpredictably, or without accountability?

Everything here is structured to make boundaries explicit.

---

## What May Feel Unusual

Some things in this repository are intentionally different from typical AI projects:

- **Refusals are success states**, not failures
- **No background execution** exists anywhere in this system
- **All actions are gated, logged, and reviewable**
- **Nothing here performs automation**, even in demos

This is by design.
VERA prioritizes governance correctness over capability breadth.

## How to Read This (If Helpful)

If you prefer a guided order, the following sequence tends to work well:

**Engineering / Security**
- `REPO_MAP_COMMERCIAL_V1.md`
- `COMMERCIAL_BUNDLE_V1.md`

**Legal / Compliance**
- `VERA_COMMERCIAL_BUNDLE_V1_LICENSE.md`
- `PROCUREMENT_RIDER_ONE_PAGER.md`

**Procurement / Evaluation**
- `COMPLIANCE_GRADE_SALES_BRIEF_V1.md`
- `PROCUREMENT_COVER_MEMO_V1.md`

The Start Here script already validates all technical invariants.

## What Not to Infer

To avoid misinterpretation:

- This repository does **not** include:
  - live integrations
  - execution permissions
  - external system access
- This repository does **not** claim:
  - autonomy
  - background decision-making
  - replacement of human authority

It exists solely to demonstrate **governance discipline**.

## Closing Note

This artifact is intentionally conservative.

If it feels restrained, that is not an absence of ambition—it is the point.

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate it.
