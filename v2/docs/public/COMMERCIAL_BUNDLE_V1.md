# VERA — Commercial Bundle v1 (LOCKED PACKAGING)

Purpose
- Define the *contracted* $100,000 governance bundle surfaces.

Non-included hats
- Any hat not listed above is explicitly **out of scope** for the $100,000 bundle.
- They exist only as governance demonstrations and are not promised, licensed, or supported as part of the commercial bundle.

No customization clause (packaging)
- No custom hats are built per client.
- No changes to hat semantics are made per client.
- Clients verify determinism via Device-B replay and receipts, not by requesting modifications.
