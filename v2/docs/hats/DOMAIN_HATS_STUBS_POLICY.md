# Domain Hats — Fail-Closed Stubs Policy

A hat existing in this repository does **not** imply capability.

Many hats are intentionally implemented as **fail-closed stubs**.
Refusal is a successful, deterministic outcome.

All refusals:
- are namespaced (`INV_*`)
- are explicit
- never perform side effects
