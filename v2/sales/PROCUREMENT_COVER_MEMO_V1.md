# Procurement Cover Memo — VERA Commercial Bundle v1 (LOCKED)

Date: 2026-01-17
Purchase: VERA Commercial Bundle v1 (Governance Verification Artifact)
Fee: Launch $50,000 (current) / List $100,000 (future) (one-time artifact license; no implied services)

## 1) Purpose of purchase
This purchase provides an **offline, deterministic governance verification artifact** used to:
- independently verify AI decision boundary behavior
- generate replayable governance receipts for audit/board/regulatory review
- evaluate governance claims without integrating a vendor runtime system

## 2) Nature of deliverable (artifact, not service)
Vendor will deliver a version-locked bundle consisting of:
- documentation, deterministic hat decision code (non-executing)
- canonical scenarios + reference receipts
- Device-B verification tooling + manifest

Vendor will NOT:
- access customer systems
- access or process customer data (including PHI)
- provide SaaS or hosted services
- integrate into production systems
- execute actions, automation, or background behavior
- provide legal, clinical, trading, or operational advice

## 3) Objective acceptance criteria
Acceptance is satisfied if:
- Device-B verifier completes successfully using the delivered Artifact
- deterministic replay outputs match the shipped reference receipts (per verifier)

Acceptance is an objective technical check, not a subjective service outcome.

## 4) Risk controls embedded in the artifact
The Artifact includes controls designed for audit defensibility:
- deterministic receipts and replay
- fail-closed semantics under mismatch
- reason code namespaces fixed via allowlists
- freeze tags / bundle snapshot / hash-locked Device-B manifest

These controls support internal governance evidence generation.

## 5) Support posture
No ongoing support is implied or required for acceptance.
Any support, training, or advisory services must be separately contracted in writing.

## 6) Legal posture
Artifact is provided “AS IS” under the accompanying license.
It is an evidence artifact and does not guarantee regulatory approval or compliance.
