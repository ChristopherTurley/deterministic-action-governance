# Platform Assistants Lens v1 (Apple/Meta-neutral)

Status: Draft v1
Scope: Governance-only lens (no product claims)
Power: Zero

## Purpose
Describe how explicit authority artifacts (proposal/decision/commit/ledger) complement platform assistants
without replacing them.

## What it does
- clarifies “suggestion vs authority”
- preserves auditability and deterministic refusals
- keeps permissions platform-owned

## What it never does
- critique platform design
- add system behaviors
- broker permissions or authority
- run in background

This lens is explanatory only.
