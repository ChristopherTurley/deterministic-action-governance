Deterministic Demo Overview

This directory contains a deterministic execution harness that demonstrates
the governance lifecycle defined in the action contract.

The demo exists to show:
- Proposal without execution
- Explicit commitment
- Conflict detection
- Deterministic refusal
- Ledgered outcomes

It is intentionally minimal and text-based.
